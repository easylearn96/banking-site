🌐 **Just built a full-stack MERN web application—crafted entirely by me, from the ground up!**

I recently completed a dynamic and responsive project using the **MERN stack**, integrating **React** (with **Vite**) on the frontend and **Node.js + Express.js** on the backend. This wasn’t just a technical exercise—it was an end-to-end journey of planning, designing, debugging, and refining every layer of the application.

✨ **Frontend Development:**
- Used **React** with **Vite**, which provided lightning-fast dev environment and Hot Module Replacement for efficient testing and updates.
- Crafted a clean UI with modular components and responsive design, ensuring a smooth user experience across all screen sizes.
- Focused on performance optimization and code maintainability to meet modern standards.

🛠️ **Backend Engineering:**
- Built a robust server-side architecture using **Express.js**, handling secure routing, API endpoints, and request validations.
- Integrated **Nodemailer** to enable seamless email functionalities like contact forms or alert systems, providing real-world utility and professional polish.
- Employed asynchronous JavaScript and middleware logic for smooth data handling and error management.

📁 **Project Highlights:**
- Fully self-developed—no templates, no team: just a hands-on demonstration of my technical grit and creative thinking.
- Learned and implemented everything from scratch, turning theory into practice and pushing myself across each layer of the stack.
- Perfected the link between functionality and user experience, making sure every feature works intuitively.
